# P2_RLEProgram
COP3502 Project 2

In this project, we were tasked with encoding and decoding data for images using run-length encoding. 

Upon start, a menu is displayed with a prompt for user input with the following options: load a file, load a test image, read RLE string, read RLE Hex string, read RLE flat data hex string, display current image, display RLE Hex data, or display flex hex data. The user should make a choice, and the  program will compute the chosen data manipulation and provide the result to the user.
